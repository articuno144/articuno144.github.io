I am a Ph.D. student at [Robotics Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/), ETH Zürich. I primarily work on learning-based agile control of legged mobile manipulators.

I grew up in [Nanjing](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/jiangsu/nanjing), and went to Singapore for [high school](https://www.victoriajc.moe.edu.sg/). Missing the four seasons, I decided to go to [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) for my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. Then I studied Robotics, Systems, and Control at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) for my master's degree, and stayed to start my Ph.D.

I believe agile control of robots is an important stepping stone towards enhancing their functionalities for tasks that require speed and fast adaptation. Learning-based approaches are promising in this direction due to less model simplifications, design heuristics, and runtime computational cost. I am currently working on [ALMA](https://rsl.ethz.ch/robots-media/alma.html) robot in this direction.
